To setup everything with python run next command:
$ pip install -e .
# Actually not required since setup is removed from root of the project.
# The next instruction should do the job instead.
# But in order to use modules from different dirs projects have to be started 
# from the .../session_local/ (root of all the projects)


To enable importing modules from different dirs: 
$ export PYTHONPATH=.
